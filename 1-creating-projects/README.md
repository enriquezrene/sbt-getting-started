# Create projects
From the console type:

sbt new sbt/scala-seed.g8

Then provide a name for your project, like:

> sbt-demo


For run sbt tasks, get inside the project directory:

```sh
cd sbt-demo
```


and type:

```sh
sbt
```

The you will see a couple of lines and you will get a line for type any task that you want:

```sh
> any_task
```

Try *run* for run your app (of course, your app is empty :) ) or *exit* for get out from sbt

The project layout is same to Maven
